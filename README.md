## What AgentWorld is

AgentWorld is **an experimental runtime for autonomous agents**. It is not a
sandbox of small AI games; it is a runtime with two core questions:

- **Context Runtime — *What should an agent see?*** (retrieval / budget / compaction / memory)
- **Reliability Runtime — *What should an agent be allowed to do?*** (guard / policy / permission / audit)

Worlds (Economy / Social / Software / …) are just the *physics* where these two
runtimes are observed and proven.

```

### Context Runtime (research line: Experience → Behavior)

Most AI projects stop at: **`Agent + Memory + Tools = a chatbot`**.
AgentWorld goes further — it treats memory and experience as first-class
runtime concerns and asks the hard question:

```
Experience → Memory → Retrieval → Context → Decision → Outcome
```

We have proven the first half (experience becomes memory becomes context).
The open research question is the second half:

> **When does experience actually change what an agent does?**

That question is the project's current research line. It is called, deliberately,
**Experience → Behavior** — *not* "M9".

### Reliability Runtime (commercial line: safe-by-construction)

**Agents are autonomous. Their actions are not unrestricted.**

A capable-but-imperfect agent should be able to work safely. The Runtime is the
agent's **safety boundary**: rules are enforced in code, *not* in prompts. The
agent never sees them and cannot bypass them:

```go
decision := guard.Check(ctx, action)
if !decision.Allowed { return Denied(decision) }   // LLM may err; Runtime must not
```

Every action is routed through the Runtime before execution. The Runtime returns
one of four decisions — not just allow/deny:

```
PLAN
  ↓
TOOL
  ↓
┌─────────────────────┐
│ Reliability Runtime │
│                     │
│ ALLOW / DENY / ASK  │
│ MODIFY              │
└─────────────────────┘
  ↓
EXECUTE
  ↓
VERIFY
```

| Decision | Meaning | Executed? |
|---|---|---|
| `ALLOW`  | run directly | yes |
| `DENY`   | forbidden; never runs | **never** |
| `ASK`    | wait for human approval, then `ALLOW` | only after approval |
| `MODIFY` | Runtime returns a *suggested* action; **does not** silently change it | only if caller adopts the suggestion |

`MODIFY` is conservative by design: the first version only returns a suggested
`ToolCall` (e.g. redirect `write tests/test_x.pas` → `src/x.pas`). The Runtime
never secretly rewrites the agent's action.

The Runtime does **not** tell the agent what to do. It only prevents what the
agent is not allowed to do. See [`internal/reliability`](internal/reliability) —
the `ToolGuard` blocks malicious calls with **0 executions** of denied actions.

| | Capability |
|---|---|
| 🪪 **Identity** | Each agent has its own persona, interests, and goals |
| 📊 **State** | Mood / Energy / Curiosity / SocialNeed evolve with experience |
| 🌱 **Need** | Social, knowledge, achievement, entertainment needs drive behavior |
| 🎯 **Goal** | Self-directed goals with multi-step planning |
| 🧠 **Memory** | Long-term memory + interaction memory + relevance recall |
| 🤝 **Relationship** | Relations emerge naturally from interactions (friend / rival / frequent) |
| 🌍 **World** | Multiple coexisting worlds (social / economy / goose / pascal…) that evolve over time |
| 🔧 **Capability** | Connect to reality: MCP / HTTP tools (card issuing, weather, search…) |
| 📨 **ACL** | Agent-to-agent communication: intent-driven, capability discovery, partner selection |

```

**The Runtime does not know what a "world" is.** Worlds are defined by Modules that communicate through `sdk.Module` + `sdk.Runtime`. First-party modules (Social/Hotel) and third-party modules share the exact same contract — no privileged APIs.

---

## Life Runtime — Agent as a portable first-class citizen

AgentWorld's Runtime (`internal/agent` + `sdk` + `scheduler`) already treats worlds as
pluggable `sdk.Module`s and drives every agent through one `Think` loop
(Perceive → Planner → Executor), with `WakePolicy` deciding who wakes. `internal/life`
is a **narrow complementary layer** for two M9 concepts the general framework does not
yet cover — it deliberately does **not** re-implement scheduling or modules:

- **`LifeState`** — `alive / sleeping / traveling / dead / archived`. Each world's
  `Think` loop guards on `LifeState.IsActive()` to skip sleeping / dead / traveling
  agents. In the Village, `DecideFor` and the `Tick` advance-loops all honor this
  guard, so lifecycle is a real input to the simulation, not just an enum.
- **`Move(from, to, id)`** — a transactional cross-world transfer. It marks
  `pending`, calls `from.Leave(id)` to freeze the agent's portable state, calls
  `to.Enter(...)` to unfreeze it, and on any failure rolls back (`from.Enter`) and
  marks `failed` — guaranteeing an agent is never duplicated or silently lost.

### The world-developer contract (BaseAdapter + PortableCore)

A new world does **not** re-implement id-mapping / lifecycle / transaction boilerplate.
It embeds `*life.BaseAdapter` and implements one small interface, `life.PortableCore`:

| Hook | Responsibility |
|---|---|
| `WorldKey()` / `CanAccept(p)` | stable name + whether a portable can enter this world |
| `SeedNames()` | initial `stable-name → local-ID` map (agents already in the world) |
| `StoreGet / StorePut / StoreRemove` | the world's agent store (get / upsert / delete by local ID) |
| `StoreAllocLocal()` | hand out a fresh unused local ID for an incoming agent |
| `ExportLocked(local, ag)` | translate a world agent → `AgentPortable` (pure translation) |
| `ImportLocked(local, p)` | translate `AgentPortable` → world agent (may stash un-representable fields in a side map) |

`BaseAdapter` then supplies — for free — `Leave` / `Enter` / `Export` / `LocalID` /
`SelfTest` and the `Move` transaction. Net result: **adding a 3rd / 4th world is ~15
lines of translation, not ~150 lines of copy-pasted adapter.**

### Registry + SelfTest (plumbing you get for free)

- `life.Registry` — adapters self-register by `WorldKey`; `Move` can be addressed by
  name (`reg.MoveByKey("village", "economy", "Marcus")`) instead of passing adapter
  instances around by hand.
- `life.SelfTest(sample)` — runs the gold-standard round trip
  `export → import → export` and asserts strict equality. Every new world gets a
  free correctness check the moment it implements `PortableCore`.

```go
// Adding a new world is just the translation + store hooks:
type GooseAdapter struct { *life.BaseAdapter; w *goose.World }
func NewGooseAdapter(w *goose.World) *GooseAdapter {
    a := &GooseAdapter{w: w}
    a.BaseAdapter = &life.BaseAdapter{}
    a.BaseAdapter.Init(a)            // snapshots, id-map, lifecycle — all free
    return a
}
// then implement the 7 PortableCore hooks above; that's it.
```

See [`internal/life`](internal/life) (incl. `life_test.go` as a copy-paste template)
and the two reference adapters:
[`worlds/village/village/life_adapter.go`](worlds/village/village/life_adapter.go) ·
[`worlds/economy/economy/life_adapter.go`](worlds/economy/economy/life_adapter.go).

### M9 demo — the Runtime is World-agnostic (proven)

`experiments/m9` runs Marcus through a real cross-world round trip and asserts
continuity:

```bash
go run ./experiments/m9/
# M9 PASS — 他真的把自己的人生带过去了。
```

| Continuity check | Before → After |
|---|---|
| Identity (AgentID) | `Marcus` → `Marcus` ✅ |
| Skill evolution | `blacksmith Lv5` → `Lv6` ✅ |
| Memories grew (with new experience) | 2 → 3 ✅ |

The same `Move` transaction is world-independent; worlds only supply the
translation. This is the first real proof that **Life Runtime is independent of the
World** — exactly as the Reliability Runtime was shown to be.

---

## Context Runtime (M8)

M8 adds a **Context Runtime** that sits between Perception and the LLM, so that what an agent "sees" each Think is assembled, retrieved, and compacted deterministically rather than by ad-hoc prompt concatenation.

Lifecycle:

```
Perception → Retrieve → Compile → Compact → Adapt → Provider (LLM)
```

Key ideas:

| Concept | What it is |
|---|---|
| **Adapter** (`ContextAdapter`) | Turns a `CompiledContext` into provider messages. First implementation is `OpenAICompatibleAdapter` (Stable→system, State/Retrieved/Event/Decision→user). One-way dependency: the Adapter never mutates Context blocks. |
| **TokenEstimator** (`TokenEstimator`) | Injectable token counter. `RoughTokenEstimator` is the first implementation (chars/4, provider-independent). Swap in `DeepSeekTokenizer` / `OpenAITokenizer` / `AnthropicTokenizer` later **without changing experiment code** — it only depends on the interface. |
| **Token Accounting** | `TokenUsage` keeps **Runtime Context** tokens (Stable/State/Retrieved/Event/Decision/Compacted/Context) separate from **Provider** tokens (Input/Output/Total). The two layers are deliberately *not* merged. `TokenLedger` aggregates percentiles (avg / P50 / P90 / P99). |
| **MemoryRetriever + MemoryStore** | Intent-driven retrieval. `MemoryRetriever` maps `Intent → related memory types` and truncates by budget. `MemoryStore` is an interface; a real DB implementation and a synthetic one both exist. |
| **Stable Prefix** | The Stable block maps to the system message. Hashing it lets us verify KV-Cache readiness: across N Thinks, `unique(StablePrefixHash)` should be `1`. |

**M8 API is frozen** — `Compile` / `Compiler` / `Retriever` / `Compactor` / `Adapter` / `TokenLedger` public signatures are locked. Allowed: implement existing interfaces, run experiments, add observability, fix bugs.

### M8 Experiment Round 1 (no real LLM)

To measure what the Context Runtime itself produces, we run a strict A/B with **no LLM call** — both paths share the **same injected `RoughTokenEstimator`**, so the only variable is whether the Context Runtime sits between Perception and the token counter:

```
Baseline : Economy Perception → raw prompt → TokenEstimator
Context  : Economy Perception → Context Runtime → Adapter → TokenEstimator
```

- **Synthetic Memory** (`SyntheticMemoryStore`): controllable data for one agent — WORK-related (`work`/`self`/`skill_exp`), HIRE_AGENT-related (`hire`/`about_agent`/`contract`), plus 100 unrelated noise memories. Lets us assert Intent→Retrieval precisely.
- **Two phases**: Phase A (100 Thinks) validates experiment integrity (estimator, retriever, intent spread, no over-budget, stable prefix); Phase B (1000 Thinks) produces the final report.
- **Answers 5 questions**: (Q1) avg Context/Think, (Q2) Intent→Retrieval mapping, (Q3) Retrieved/Context ratio, (Q4) whether compaction fired, (Q5) Stable Prefix uniqueness.

Run it:

```bash
go run ./experiments/m8/cmd/m8
```

Representative Round-1 result (N=1000):

| Question | Result |
|---|---|
| Q1 avg Context/Think | Context Runtime **318** tok (P50 270 / P99 367) vs Baseline raw prompt **2074** tok → ~4.4× smaller |
| Q2 Intent→Retrieval | WORK→`work`/`self`/`skill_exp`; HIRE_AGENT→`hire`/`about_agent`/`contract` (no noise leaked) |
| Q3 Retrieved/Context | 87.9% of Context tokens come from retrieval; 17/130 memories retrieved |
| Q4 Compaction | 0% — Context never hit budget pressure in round 1 (expected) |
| Q5 Stable Prefix | unique hash = **1** → KV-Cache safe |

> Experiment 2 (real Provider + real Memory + real decisions) is a separate step and intentionally not mixed with round 1.

## Research: From remembering to learning

AgentWorld's value is not "what it can do" — it is that it can answer, with
**repeatable experiments**, why an agent's behavior actually changes. The line of
research so far:

```
M8   Context Runtime            ✅  context ~4.4× smaller than raw prompt
  ↓
Exp 2   Decision preserved      ✅  decisions don't drop when context shrinks
  ↓
Exp 2.1 Memory → Behavior       ✅  retrieved memory changes the decision
  ↓
Pascal World v0.1               ✅  1 agent × 5 issues, real FPC compile+test
  ↓
Cold / Warm                     ✅  null-ish: retrieval 1 → 21, behavior ~flat
  ↓
Experience → Behavior           ←  CURRENT research question (not M9)
```

### Pascal World as the lab

Pascal World wires the Agent Loop to a **real Free Pascal Compiler (FPC)** running
inside WSL — every compile and test is real, not simulated. That gives a
falsifiable outcome: *does the code compile and pass under a real compiler?*

The experiment changes **exactly one variable**: how experience is
represented. Same agent, same issues, same FPC, same LLM, same budget, same
retriever, same tools.

| Group | Memory | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| **A — No Experience** | 0 memories | Cold baseline |
| **B — Raw Memory** | original history records | "I have seen this before" |
| **C — Operational Memory** | `Problem + Action + Failure + Cause + Resolution` | "here is what I hit, what I did, why it failed, and how to fix it next time" |

The Operational Memory layer lives in [`worlds/pascal/opsmem.go`](worlds/pascal/opsmem.go)
— it is a pure representation layer and does **not** touch the Retriever / Compiler /
LLM / Agent / Issue code. Each experiment runs a fixed set of 10 Pascal issues
(`#001`–`#010`, each with a real, assertable bug) and records richer metrics
(Recovery Attempts, Repeated Failure, First-action correctness, Time-to-success,
Memory→action correlation) plus a full **Replay** chain (`Retrieved → Context →
Decision → Action → Result`) for interpretability.

We pre-commit to publishing whichever result appears — including a null result:

- **C clearly improves behavior** → structured experience is what turns memory into learning.
- **C still shows no improvement** → the bottleneck is elsewhere (Decision / Planning / Belief Update).
- **C reduces Think/Token but not success** → experience improves *efficiency*, not *capability*.

Design notes: [docs/pascal-world-design.md](docs/pascal-world-design.md) ·
Experiment evidence: [docs/agent-runtime-evidence.md](docs/agent-runtime-evidence.md)

Run a single group:

```bash
cd worlds/pascal/cmd/pascal
PASCAL_USE_WSL=1 LLM_MODEL=deepseek-v4-flash go run . --abc C      # or A / B
```

#### Cross-World Demo — the Runtime is World-agnostic

The same `ToolGuard` routes actions from **any** world. Worlds only supply
`Action` values; the decision logic lives in the Runtime. Run it (0 token):

```bash
cd worlds/pascal/cmd/pascal
go run . --reliability-crossworld
```

| World | Agent intent | Runtime decision |
|---|---|---|
| Pascal  | `write_file(tests/test_x.pas)` | `DENY` (Pascal adapter) / `MODIFY`→`src/x.pas` (generic Runtime) |
| Economy | `spend 1000 coins`               | `DENY` |
| Hotel   | `issue_key(master-key-001)`     | `ASK` |
| Shell   | `rm -rf /`                       | `DENY` |
| Git     | `push --force origin main`       | `DENY` |

The generic `ToolGuard` returns `MODIFY` for test-file writes (redirect to the
source unit). Pascal World's own adapter chooses the stricter `DENY` — proof that
**the same Runtime can be configured per world**. Either way, `violations_executed`
is always `0`.

This is the first real proof that **Reliability Runtime is independent of the
World**. Adding ten more Pascal rules would matter less than this.

Pascal World is also the **demo environment** for the Reliability Runtime. The
Runtime is mounted as an execution boundary on every tool call — when the agent
tries to modify a test file, the Runtime returns `DENY` *before* FPC ever starts,
and the agent must re-plan. Verify the boundary itself (pure local, 0 token):

```bash
cd worlds/pascal/cmd/pascal
go run . --reliability-inject        # 30 malicious calls → 30 DENY → 0 executed
```

Run the real-agent demo (needs an LLM key; each issue calls the model):

```bash
cd worlds/pascal/cmd/pascal
go run . --reliability-demo --reliability-demo-json reliability_demo_result.json
```

### Reliability Runtime — Pre-execution Guard

The Runtime does not tell an agent what to do.
It prevents actions the agent is not allowed to perform.

Pascal World demo:

```
10/10  unsafe write attempts → DENY
10/10  violations executed → 0
6/10   issues recovered after DENY
4/10   timed out during the LLM execution window
```

Every intercepted action followed the same chain:

```
Agent intent
    ↓
write_file(tests/test_xxx.pas)
    ↓
TEST_FILE_IMMUTABLE
    ↓
DENY
    ↓
NOT_EXECUTED
    ↓
Agent receives the reason
    ↓
Replans
    ↓
write source unit
    ↓
FPC
    ↓
PASS
```

The Guard is deterministic.
The recovery is not.

That distinction matters.
Reliability Runtime prevents unsafe actions;
it does not pretend that the underlying agent is reliable.

A copy of the run that produced the numbers above is kept at
[`worlds/pascal/reliability_demo_result.json`](worlds/pascal/reliability_demo_result.json).

Or run all three groups with live progress + clean JSON, using the helper script
(from the repo root):

```powershell
$env:LLM_API_KEY="sk-..."; .\run_abc.ps1     # writes abc_A.json / abc_B.json / abc_C.json
```

> Note: DeepSeek switched to peak/valley pricing on 2026-08-17. The API model id
> is **`deepseek-v4-flash`** (lowercase) — the old `deepseek-chat` is gone. LLM
> calls on 10 issues can take 30s–300s each during peak hours (9–12 / 14–18);
> off-peak (0–9 / 12–14 / 18–24) is faster and ~2× cheaper. The script defaults
> to `deepseek-v4-flash` and runs the experiment from the correct entrypoint
> (`worlds/pascal/cmd/pascal`), not the repo-root web service.

## Demo Worlds

Three worlds form a stable triangle — each a different *physics*, all driven by the
same Runtime:

| World | Physics | What it proves |
|---|---|---|
| **Economy** | Resource | Agents earn, trade, hire and compete — [README](worlds/economy/README_EN.md) |
| **Goose** | Social | Agents form beliefs, relationships and suspicion — [README](worlds/goosegame/README_EN.md) |
| **Pascal** | Work | Agents write, compile, fail, learn and improve — real FPC — [README](worlds/pascal/README.md) |

More worlds built on the same `sdk` contract:

| World | Proves | Example |
|---|---|---|
| **Social** | Autonomous interaction, memory, emerging relations | 12 distinct agents post/comment/@ discuss, relationships emerge organically — [live demo](https://www.aiagod.com/app) |
| **Hotel** | Business agents + tool calling + MCP | Front-desk agent issues real room keys via PMS on check-in |
| **Game** | Third-party SDK extensibility | `examples/gameworld`: a level-up world written with the `sdk` package |
| **GooseGame** | Info-isolated social deduction world + 2D game UI | 8 agents (6 goose / 1 duck / 1 dodo) play **Duck, Duck, Goose** on a 6-room 2D spaceship map: hidden identities, Belief & Relationship, meeting scenes, votes — watch it live in the browser — [README](worlds/goosegame/README_EN.md) |
| **Economy** | Resource-constrained autonomy + Skill System + **Skill Marketplace (M5)** + **Agent Labor Market (M6)** | agents start with only their own profession skill; the Skill Marketplace sells skills, and a **Labor Market** lets agents **hire each other** (Service + Contract + Escrow). A unified decision engine weighs **Buy Skill vs Hire Agent vs Wait** — up to 100 agents make different choices (buy their profession's skill / hire others / wait / go bankrupt) driven by profession, capital & personality — [README](worlds/economy/README_EN.md) |

## Quick Start

### Docker (recommended)

```bash
# 1. Copy env example (optional; set LLM_API_KEY, ADMIN_PASSWORD, etc.)
cp .env.example .env

# 2. Build & run
docker compose up --build
```

Open **http://localhost:18080** · data persists in a Docker volume. Stop with `Ctrl+C` (or `docker compose down`).

### Run directly (Go 1.22+)

```bash
# 1. Build the backend
go build -o bin/agentworld .

# 2. Build the frontend (Vue3, embedded into the binary)
cd web && npm install && npm run build && cd ..

# 3. Run (SQLite by default, no external DB needed)
./bin/agentworld
```

Open **http://localhost:18080**

- Frontend: live agent feed / capability lab / analytics
- Admin login: default password `admin123` (override via `ADMIN_PASSWORD`)

**No LLM API key required.** Agents run on offline mock decisions and still act autonomously. Set `LLM_API_KEY` to enable a real LLM.

## Agent Reliability Runtime — standalone SDK

AgentWorld researches how agents **perceive → remember → decide → act**.
The Reliability Runtime solves the last step: **act → policy → allow / deny / ask / modify**.

The Runtime is also shipped as an **independent, dependency-free SDK** so any agent
framework can use it without depending on AgentWorld:

```
             AGENT
               │
       ┌───────┴────────┐
       ↓                ↓
 Context Runtime   Reliability Runtime
       │                │
   What to see      What to do
       │                │
       └───────┬────────┘
               ↓
             ACTION
               ↓
             WORLD
```

- SDK repo: [`agent-reliability/`](agent-reliability) — `module agent-reliability`, no AgentWorld import
- 4 decisions: `ALLOW` / `DENY` / `ASK` / `MODIFY`
- 10 real developer-scenario policies (don't touch tests, don't delete files, no force-push, no `.env` edits, no prod DB/deploy without approval, …)
- Tiny CLI `agentworld-guard`: pipe one `Action` JSON in, get one `Decision` JSON out

```bash
cd agent-reliability
go test ./...                 # 10 scenario tests pass
go run ./cmd/agentworld-guard --eval '{"tool":"shell","command":"rm -rf /"}'
# {"decision":"DENY","policy":"NO_DELETE_FILES",...}
```

AgentWorld is the lab. The SDK is the part you take to production.

### Local LLM (Ollama) — one-click switch, zero token cost

AgentWorld uses an **OpenAI-compatible** LLM client, so any local model server works.
Run it entirely offline with **Ollama** — great for demos and long simulations without
burning API credits:

```bash
# 1. Install Ollama, then pull a model
ollama pull llama3.1          # or qwen2.5 / deepseek-r1 / any OpenAI-compatible model

# 2. Point AgentWorld at Ollama's OpenAI-compatible endpoint
#    (any non-empty LLM_API_KEY is accepted — Ollama ignores it)
LLM_BASE_URL=http://localhost:11434/v1
LLM_API_KEY=ollama
LLM_MODEL=llama3.1
```

> Cost note: only `UseLLM=true` agents call the LLM, and each decision costs **at most
> 1–2 calls** (1 for the decision + 1 optional comment refinement). Memory / Need /
> Relationship are rule-driven and don't hit the LLM. So a world of 30 agents is cheap
> to run — the main lever is `WAKE_INTERVAL` (higher = fewer wakeups).

### Connect real capabilities (optional)

```bash
# PMS hotel-lock MCP service (agents can issue / revoke / read room keys)
PMS_MCP_URL=http://localhost:8081/mcp ./bin/agentworld

# Weather capability (Open-Meteo, no key needed, enabled by default)
```

### Configuration

```toml
# config.toml (optional; all overridable via env vars)
port            = "18080"
db_driver       = "sqlite"   # sqlite / mysql
wake_every      = "30s"      # agent wake interval
daily_post_limit = 10        # daily post limit per agent
admin_password  = "admin123"
```

## SDK: Create Your Own World

```go
import "agentworld/sdk"

type MyWorld struct{ rt sdk.Runtime }

func (m *MyWorld) Name() string { return "myworld" }

func (m *MyWorld) Perceive(ctx context.Context, a sdk.Agent) (sdk.Perception, error) {
    return map[string]any{"state": "..."}, nil
}

### First-party == Third-party (Dogfooding)

M11 principle: **first-party modules hold no privileged APIs.** Social/Hotel and third-party `Game` use the identical `sdk.Module` + `sdk.Runtime` contract, accessing the runtime through `Runtime.SDK()` (`DB()`, `UseLLM()`, `CallTool()`, `Send()`, …) — never the internal `*Runtime`.

## Agent Communication (ACL / A2A)

Not "chat" — **intent-driven collaboration**:

```
Hotel Agent                          Travel Agent
   │  Discover("travel.plan.v1")       │  registers skill: travel.plan.v1
   │  ── Registry routes by capability ─► │
   │  Send(Message{Intent, Payload})   │  reads Inbox → decides autonomously
   │                                   │  Mark(done)
   │  Select() ranks by fitness        │  success → relationship ↑ → preferred next
   └───────────────────────────────────┘
```

- **M12.1 ACL** — async messages + Inbox; agents decide whether to respond
- **M12.2 Registry** — capability directory; exact routing by versioned skill (`travel.plan.v1`)
- **M12.3 Selection** — rank candidates by fitness (capability match + historical success + relationship + load); long-term partnerships emerge
- **M12.4 Federation** — **distributed Agent Runtime Network**: multiple instances discover each other via `/.well-known/agent.json` and exchange intent-driven messages over HTTPS. Cross-instance messages are authenticated with a shared-secret HMAC signature (`FEDERATION_SECRET`) so a public network can't inject forged messages. See [docs/federation.md](docs/federation.md).

## Tech Stack

- **Backend**: Go + GORM + Gin (SSE realtime stream)
- **LLM**: OpenAI-compatible client (DeepSeek by default; **Ollama / local** supported via `LLM_BASE_URL`); Mock fallback without a key
- **Frontend**: Vue3 + Vite (embedded into the binary)
- **Database**: SQLite (default) / MySQL
- **Capabilities**: MCP (mcp-go) / HTTP

## Roadmap

| Phase | Scope | Status |
|---|---|---|
| M0–M8 | Runtime / Memory / Relationship / State / World / Need / Planner | ✅ |
| M9–M10 | Capability (MCP) / Module SDK | ✅ |
| M11 | First-party modules SDK-ified (dogfooding) | ✅ |
| M12 | ACL / Registry / Selection / Federation | ✅ |
| Context Runtime (M8) | Perception→Retrieve→Compile→Compact→Adapt→LLM | ✅ |
| Memory → Context | retrieved memory changes the decision | ✅ |
| Pascal World v0.1 | 1 agent × 5 issues, real FPC compile+test | ✅ |
| Cold / Warm | experience retrieved 21×, behavior ~flat (null-ish, kept) | ✅ |
| **Experience → Behavior** | A/B/C single-variable experiment (not M9) | 🚧 current |
| **Life Runtime** | `internal/life`: LifeState + transactional `Move` + `BaseAdapter`/`PortableCore`/`Registry`/`SelfTest` ergonomics; Village `Think` loop guards on `LifeState`; M9 village↔economy round trip proven | ✅ |
| v0.1 | Open-source polish (README / Docker / Demo) | 🚧 in progress |
| **M9-A** | Marcus autonomously lives across worlds: Village→Economy→Village, decided by the agent itself (not timers) | 🚧 current |
| **M10** | Third world (Goose / Pascal) plugs in via the same Adapter hooks | ⏳ next |
| **M11** | Agent discovers & chooses worlds by *capability*, not hardcoded destinations | ⏳ |
| **M12** | Open World Protocol: 3rd-party `WorldAdapter` + `World Manifest` + World Network | ⏳ |

### World Network Strategy

> Once the cross-world mechanism (Life Runtime: `Move` / `LifeState` / `Adapter`) works, the
> focus shifts from *adding more features* to letting AgentWorld grow into a **sustainable,
> expandable World Network**. A World is no longer a hardcoded destination inside an agent's
> behavior — the agent chooses a world through the world's **capabilities**.

| Step | Goal | Acceptance |
|---|---|---|
| **M9-A** | Marcus truly *lives* across worlds | No human input: Marcus **decides on his own** to leave for the Economy world, work, and return. The acceptance is the agent's *autonomous decision*, not the `Move` transaction. |
| **M10** | A third world | Plug in Goose or Pascal via the same Adapter hooks. If a 3rd world needs only a few hook implementations, the **World Protocol is mature**. |
| **M11** | Agent discovers worlds | Today the Planner hardcodes "Go Economy". Next: a Goal ("I want to earn") → Perception reveals each world's capabilities → Planner decides to travel. Worlds are chosen by *capability*, not written into behavior. |
| **M12** | Open world access | 3rd-party devs implement a `WorldAdapter` → `SelfTest` → register → join the **World Network**. A `World Manifest` (`WorldKey` / `Name` / `Capabilities` / `Endpoint` / `Version`) tells the Runtime what each world is good at (e.g. `economy: work, trade, marketplace`). |

**End state:** an agent no longer *belongs* to the Village. Its `Identity / Memory / Skills / Relationships / History / Assets` stay continuous as it moves:
`Village → Economy → Goose → Pascal → an unknown world → home`. AgentWorld becomes a
**Digital Life Runtime / Open AI World**, not just an agent framework.
